Subject line: imperative mood, 50 chars max, no period\n4. If changes are complex, add a body explaining WHY and WHAT\n5. Focus on business logic and functionality, not just file changes\n6. Group related changes in bullet points if needed\n7. Match the style and tone of recent commits\n\nIMPORTANT: Return ONLY the commit message.
